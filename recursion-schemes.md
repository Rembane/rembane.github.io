# Recursion schemes

I fell down into the recursion scheme rabbit hole when I wanted to write a small interpreter without doing the recursion manually. Eventually I will write something about this adventure, or at least give some sources on how other people have used recursion schemes. But for now I will just post links and notes.

* [Time traveling recursion](https://jtobin.io/time-traveling-recursion) About histomorphisms and futumorphisms.
* [Don't fear the cat-amorphism (nor the hylomorphism)](http://fho.f12n.de/posts/2014-05-07-dont-fear-the-cat.html) On how to implement mergesort as a hylomorphism. First unfold, then fold. And the fusion involved.
* [StackOverflow: Histomorphisms, Zygomorphisms and Futumorphisms specialised to lists](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36851766/histomorphisms-zygomorphisms-and-futumorphisms-specialised-to-lists) Examples of some morphisms.
* [Bottom-up Type Annotation with the Cofree Comonad](https://brianmckenna.org/blog/type_annotation_cofree) Wow.
