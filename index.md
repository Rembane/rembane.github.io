# What do you need to know ...

This page tries to answer what you need to know to be a productive computer (engineer\|scientist). I mainly focus on Linux systems, command line skillz and other things you get a long beard from. There is more ... there is always more ...

## Git

Git has become the defacto standard for [distributed version control systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_version_control). If you know Git it will become much easier to collaborate with other programmers, since they are already using it.

## LaTeX

LaTeX is the ultimate tool for creating reports, mathematical equations, meeting minutes, and so on. It has a long and very organic history which makes it ancient and quite weird.

## Editor

Learn an editor you can use from the command line. I prefer [vim](https://www.vim.org), others prefer [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). You could of course use [nano](https://www.nano-editor.org/) or some other simplistic editor, but they won't exercise your brain as much.

The main point I want to make is that you can get very productive and learn how hackers think by learning to use an editor that hackers use. It's also very useful to know how to edit something from the command line if you happen to SSH into a box without a GUI.

## TODO:

* Basic command line skillz
* Writing
* A scripting language
